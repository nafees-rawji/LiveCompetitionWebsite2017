    <p class="text-white past-cbm-text my-4 text-left ml-auto">When I was invited to become a Campus Brand Manager for
        LIVE Competition 2014, I knew that this would be a great opportunity to begin my journey in the business world
        and expand my network. I was nervous not knowing anyone and being a rst year student, I don’t have nearly as
        much experience compared to most delegates. Again, I knew this would be an amazing chance to represent my school
        and my city at LIVE. My experience at LIVE was unforgettable. I loved how welcoming everyone was, from the
        executive team, to my team mates. I would recommend competing at LIVE because it does not only allow to create
        new friendships, but it is a competition that challenges you to work and think like you never have before. LIVE
        Competition is a great learning experience lled with amazing
        people that share the same passion as you.</p>
